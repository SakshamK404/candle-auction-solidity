# candle-auction-solidity
This project implements a decentralized candle auction using Solidity, Truffle, and OpenZeppelin. Participants place bids, and the highest bidder wins. Comprehensive tests ensure functionality and security, covering bid placements, withdrawals, auction endings, and reentrancy attack prevention.
